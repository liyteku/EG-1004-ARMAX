# EG-1004-ARMAX

## Overview
ARMAX is a Semester-Long Design Project (SLDP) for EG-1004 in NYU Tandon at 2024 Spring.

## Introduction
The purpose of the project is to develop an innovative arm rehabilitation device aimed at revolutionizing children's therapy.
This device, named ARMAX, seeks to address several key objectives: reducing rehabilitation time, enhancing engagement during therapy sessions, and providing an affordable solution for families.
ARMAX combines functionality with entertainment, offering a fun wrist-brace that not only accelerates rehabilitation but also makes the process enjoyable for young patients.

## Requirements
The components used to build ARMAX include a 3D-printed cast for the outer shell.
For the inner padding, two ft2 of fabric were used and two feet of foam.
Three sticks of glue were used throughout the model as an adhesive.
Ten inches of velcro were used to attach the two pieces of the cast.
To create a hand sleeve, eight ft2 of stretch fabric was used. To house the Arduino, a two-piece block was 3D printed. 
To build ARMAX hardware part, a Sparkfun Redboard, a 3-axis gyro sensor, an HC-05 Bluetooth module, a 0.96-inch OLED screen, a breadboard, a speaker, a battery, and several jumper wires were used.
